This is a StarCraft II Zerg Bot coded in Python.
It uses Blizzard and Deepmind's API, as well as BurnySC2 API.

The Linux environment to run this bot can be setup using [setup.sh](setup.sh).
Once the environment is setup, you can run a game using [playGame.py](src/playGame.py).

This bot is as it's first stage of development and is not maintained anymore.
